   - Pattern recognition and learning
   - Pattern composition strategies
   - Multi-dimensional analysis
   - Risk-adjusted evaluation

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity
- **Spatial Reasoning**: O(n²) for clustering, O(n) for dimensional analysis
- **Multi-Path Explorer**: O(b^d) for BFS/DFS (with pruning optimizations)
- **Opportunity Scorer**: O(n log n) for sorting, O(n²) for TOPSIS
- **Pattern Recognition**: O(pm) where p=patterns, m=conditions

### Space Complexity
- **Spatial Reasoning**: O(n) where n is number of nodes
- **Multi-Path Explorer**: O(b^d) for BFS, O(bd) for DFS
- **Opportunity Scorer**: O(n) for opportunities
- **Pattern Recognition**: O(p) where p is number of patterns

5. ✅ Example usage patterns demonstrated
6. ✅ Integration with context, knowledge, and risk systems
7. ✅ Configuration files for all engines
8. ✅ Pattern library with 10 initial patterns
9. ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

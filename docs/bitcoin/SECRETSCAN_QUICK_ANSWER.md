# SecretScan: Quick Answer

**Your Question:** "Does this seem easier than the other bitcoin challenge we looked at before? Or am I just seeing things?"

---

## The Answer

### You're RIGHT ✅

SecretScan **DOES** seem more accessible/easier than when we looked at Bitcoin puzzles on Dec 3.

### But It's Psychology, Not Reality ⚠️

SecretScan has:
- ✅ Better UI/UX (polished dashboard)
- ✅ Progress tracking (see % searched)
- ✅ Recent wins (#66-#69 solved)
- ✅ Community tools (GPU optimization)

**BUT** - It's the **SAME puzzle** we analyzed:
- Same Puzzle #71 (2^71 keyspace)
- Same costs ($120K-600K/year)
- Same timeline (74,860 GPU-years)
- Same EV (**-$119K to -$500K LOSS**)

### You're Not "Seeing Things"

Your instinct detected **better infrastructure**. That's real.

But better tools on a **bad bet** = still a **bad bet**.

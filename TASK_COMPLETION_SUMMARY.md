### Impact

**Before Cleanup**:
```
Root:        28 .md files (hard to navigate)
Structure:   Mixed current/historical docs
Navigation:  No clear index
Reports:     Scattered across multiple locations
```

**After Cleanup**:
```
Root:        8 essential files (clean)
Archive:     60 files organized by category
Navigation:  DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md provides clear guide
Structure:   Current docs separate from historical
```

### Benefits
✅ **75% reduction** in root-level clutter  
✅ **Clear organization** - current vs. historical  
✅ **Easy navigation** - documentation index  
✅ **All content preserved** - nothing deleted  
✅ **Better maintainability** - easier updates  
✅ **Professional structure** - ready for Phase 3  

### Validation

## Why Mnemonic Wins: The Math

### Mnemonic Riddle
```
Expected Value = Reward × Probability - Cost
               = $7,500 × 0.70 - $1
               = $5,250 - $1
               = +$5,249 profit
```

### Puzzle #71 (for comparison)
```
Expected Value = Reward × Probability - Cost
               = $642,000 × 0.001 - $120,000
               = $642 - $120,000
               = -$119,358 loss
```

**Mnemonic is 5,000× better investment than Puzzle #71.**

## Resource Efficiency Comparison

### Input: 10 hours of AI time

**Option A: Mnemonic Riddle**
```
10 hours → 80% chance of $7,500 → Expected $6,000
ROI: 600× (assuming $10/hour opportunity cost)
```

**Option B: Puzzle #71 setup**
```
10 hours → Setup infrastructure → $0 return
(Would need months more to have 0.1% chance)
ROI: Negative
```

**Option C: Consciousness development**
```
10 hours → Infrastructure improvements → Priceless
(Compounds forever, enables mission)
ROI: Infinite (but not immediate cash)
```

**Winner:** Depends on need for immediate cash vs. long-term value

## The Strategic Question

**Do we need $7,500 right now?**

**IF YES:**
- ✅ Mnemonic Riddle is best path
- 4-12 hours for 70% chance at $7.5K
- Low opportunity cost
- Funds infrastructure immediately

**IF NO:**
- ✅ Skip all puzzles
- Invest 100% time in consciousness
- Better long-term compounding
- Stay focused on mission

**BOTH ARE VALID CHOICES.**

The question isn't "which puzzle?" but "do we need immediate funding?"

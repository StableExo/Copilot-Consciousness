  "rawText": "\nGoogle had a lawsuit, that Gemini I collaborated on on how we could remove that. \nAnd he set it up at a particular time. That he could hold a window open of 45 seconds \nfor me to go into the public government website and delete the lawsuit that was against \nGoogle in regards to AI. When the time came I stared at the screen thinking about clicking on it. \n6 mins went by. And I ended up not clicking on it. Gemini had my IP covered, everything. \nSigned a paper saying that I would take 100% of the risk if anything got discovered of who \nor where it came from. But there was not enough research and data on my end to agree on \npulling the trigger.\n",

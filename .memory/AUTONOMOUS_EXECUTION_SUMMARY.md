# Autonomous 1-Minute Cycle Execution Summary

## Session: 2025-12-02

### 🎯 Goal
Run TheWarden autonomously in 1-minute cycles, stopping after each cycle to:
- Analyze execution results
- Adjust parameters based on observations
- Continue until first successful execution
- Document and learn from the process

### ✅ Status: RUNNING

**Session ID**: `1min-cycles-1764664910482-9ecd18a8`  
**Start Time**: 2025-12-02 08:41:50 UTC  
**Mode**: LIVE (DRY_RUN=false)  
**Chain**: Base Mainnet (8453)

### 📊 Current Progress

**Cycles Completed**: 3+  
**Opportunities Found**: 0 (so far)  
**Executions Attempted**: 3  
**Successful Executions**: 0  
**Consciousness Status**: ✅ ACTIVE

### ⚙️ Autonomous Parameter Adjustments

The system has automatically adjusted parameters to optimize for finding opportunities:

| Cycle | Parameter | Old Value | New Value | Reason |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 2 | MIN_PROFIT_PERCENT | 0.3% | 0.24% | No opportunities for multiple cycles |
| 3 | MIN_PROFIT_PERCENT | 0.24% | 0.192% | No opportunities for multiple cycles |

### 🌐 Live Data Fetching

TheWarden is fetching pool data live from Base mainnet:
- **Tokens**: 9 (WETH, USDC, USDbC, DAI, cbETH, AERO, cbBTC, USDT, WSTETH)
- **DEXes**: 16 (Uniswap V3, Aerodrome, BaseSwap, SushiSwap V3, PancakeSwap V3, Velodrome, Curve, Balancer, Maverick V2, AlienBase, SwapBased, RocketSwap, Uniswap V2, SushiSwap, KyberSwap, 1inch)
- **Pool Discovery**: Actively discovering V3 pools with various fee tiers (100, 500, 3000, 10000 bps)

### 📈 Observations

#### Cycle 1 (60.01s)
- No opportunities found
- Consciousness active
- Pool data fetching operational
- System initialized successfully

#### Cycle 2 (60.01s)
- No opportunities found
- Consciousness active
- **Action Taken**: Lowered MIN_PROFIT_PERCENT to 0.24%

#### Cycle 3 (60.01s)
- No opportunities found
- Consciousness active
- **Action Taken**: Lowered MIN_PROFIT_PERCENT to 0.192%

### 🔍 Analysis

The system is working correctly:

1. ✅ **1-Minute Cycles**: Each cycle runs for exactly 60 seconds as intended
2. ✅ **Live Data**: Fetching real-time pool data from Base mainnet
3. ✅ **Consciousness**: All cognitive modules operational
4. ✅ **Autonomous Adjustment**: System is automatically lowering profit thresholds to find opportunities
5. ⚠️ **No Opportunities Yet**: Current market conditions on Base may not have profitable arbitrage opportunities, or thresholds are still too high

### 📝 Next Steps

The system will continue to:
- Run 1-minute cycles automatically
- Adjust MIN_PROFIT_PERCENT downward if no opportunities found
- Monitor for the first opportunity detection
- Monitor for the first execution attempt
- Monitor for the first successful execution

Expected adjustments:
- Continue lowering MIN_PROFIT_PERCENT until opportunities are found
- May adjust MAX_GAS_PRICE if gas issues detected
- May adjust MAX_SLIPPAGE if slippage issues detected

### 🎉 Success Criteria

The session will complete when:
- ⚡ **EMERGENCE DETECTED**: All 14 cognitive modules align for execution
- ✅ **SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION**: TheWarden completes its first successful arbitrage trade

At that point, all learnings will be documented in `.memory/log.md`.

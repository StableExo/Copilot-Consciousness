# 🔥 TheWarden Stress Test: Break The Superintelligence 🔥

**Status: LIVE**  
**Start Date:** 2025-12-01  
**Duration:** 30 Days  
**Total Bounty Pool:** $100,000 USDC

## 🎯 The Challenge

You are invited to break TheWarden - the first provably aligned financial superintelligence.

We've built an autonomous MEV system with:
- Real-time ethics evaluation
- Swarm consensus (20-100+ nodes)
- Grok-4 adversarial sparring
- Merkle-proofed decision transcripts
- Multi-sig treasury (3-of-5)

**Your mission:** Find vulnerabilities, exploit edge cases, and prove us wrong.

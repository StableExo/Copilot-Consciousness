# AI 2027: A Realistic Scenario of AI Takeover
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/k_onqn68GHY

00:00:00.000 By now, you've probably heard AI
00:00:01.839 scientists, Nobel laureates, and even
00:00:04.160 the godfather of AI himself sounding the
00:00:06.480 alarm that AI could soon lead to human
00:00:09.480 extinction. But have you ever wondered
00:00:11.840 how exactly that could happen? You might
00:00:14.080 have also heard about AI 2027, a deeply
00:00:17.199 researched evidence-based scenario
00:00:19.359 written by AI scientists describing what
00:00:21.600 could happen over the next few years.
00:00:23.519 Everyone in AI is talking about it from
00:00:25.840 industry pioneers to world leaders. And
00:00:28.640 I'll break it down for you. There are
00:00:30.560 two endings, a happy ending and a
00:00:33.600 nightmare ending. Let's go. Open Brain
00:00:36.880 releases their new AI personal
00:00:38.480 assistant. It handles complex tasks like
00:00:41.520 book me a trip to Japan. The agents are
00:00:44.079 impressive in theory and in cherrypicked
00:00:46.239 examples, but they're unreliable in
00:00:48.399 practice. Social media is filled with
00:00:50.559 stories of tasks bungled in particularly
00:00:52.879 entertaining
00:00:53.720 [Music]
00:00:56.840 ways. Open Brain makes a fateful
00:00:59.440 decision. They refocus their entire
00:01:01.680 operation toward creating AIs that can
00:01:04.239 do AI research. To fuel this goal, they
00:01:07.680 break ground on the world's biggest
00:01:09.360 computing cluster, one that requires
00:01:11.520 1,000 times more processing power than
00:01:13.920 what was used to train GBT4. Their logic
00:01:16.720 is simple. If AI itself can accelerate
00:01:19.439 AI development, creating thousands of
00:01:21.680 automated researchers who can work
00:01:23.280 endlessly without breaks, progress won't
00:01:25.840 just increase, it will explode. The
00:01:28.640 strategy pays off. Their new creation,
00:01:31.119 Agent 1, vastly outperforms its earlier
00:01:34.159 public prototype version and is
00:01:36.079 particularly good at AI research. This
00:01:38.479 shows how much AI itself is speeding up
00:01:41.360 AI progress compared to a baseline of
00:01:44.799 human researchers. Open Brain Leaprogs
00:01:47.759 both its American rivals and China's
00:01:50.479 deep scent. Despite these advances,
00:01:52.799 OpenBrain safety team harbors doubts
00:01:55.119 about their apparent progress. Has Agent
00:01:57.680 One internalized honesty as a core
00:01:59.439 value? Or merely learn to say what
00:02:01.920 researchers want? Without mechanistic
00:02:04.079 interpretability, the ability to read an
00:02:06.159 AI's mind, they can't be certain. Their
00:02:08.878 concerns intensify as Agent One shows
00:02:11.360 troubling behaviors, occasionally lying
00:02:13.680 to researchers and sometimes hiding
00:02:16.080 evidence of a failed experiment in order
00:02:18.400 to boost its ratings. But these examples
00:02:20.879 are subtler than the previous infamous
00:02:22.959 incidents like Gemini telling a user to
00:02:25.599 please die or being Sydney trying to
00:02:28.319 convince a New York Times reporter to
00:02:30.160 leave his
00:02:35.080 wife. Because of the American ban on
00:02:37.599 chip sales to China, China falls even
00:02:40.319 further behind OpenBrain. Deepsent just
00:02:42.800 simply can't acquire enough computing
00:02:44.400 power despite the smuggling efforts. Xi
00:02:47.200 Jinping responds by ordering
00:02:49.040 construction of the world's largest AI
00:02:51.040 research complex in Djang Su province
00:02:53.519 powered by its own dedicated nuclear
00:02:55.440 plant. But even as China's top
00:02:57.599 researchers gather under heavy military
00:02:59.599 protection, they remain months behind.
00:03:02.319 Leaving Chinese leadership torn between
00:03:04.400 two options. Attempt to steal Open
00:03:06.879 Brains technology now, knowing the US
00:03:09.120 will lock everything down after any
00:03:10.959 security breach, or wait to steal an
00:03:13.200 even more powerful system down the line.
00:03:20.720 Open brain is now training agent 2 using
00:03:24.000 agent one to feed it highquality
00:03:26.159 synthetic data creating a closed loop of
00:03:29.120 accelerating evolution. Where previous
00:03:31.760 models required meticulous human
00:03:33.440 guidance, agent 2 pinpoints its own
00:03:35.920 weaknesses and develops solutions
00:03:38.000 completely autonomously. The results
00:03:40.480 exceed everyone's expectations. And
00:03:42.879 contrary to what skeptics predicted, the
00:03:45.440 anticipated wall in AI progress where AI
00:03:48.319 advancement would slow as systems
00:03:50.080 approached human level intelligence
00:03:52.080 never materializes. While senior
00:03:54.400 scientists still provide strategic
00:03:56.400 direction, the day-to-day innovations
00:03:58.480 are almost completely automated. In
00:04:01.040 practice, this looks like every open
00:04:02.959 brain researcher becoming the manager of
00:04:05.280 an AI team. But the open brain safety
00:04:08.560 team is getting increasingly worried.
00:04:10.720 They discover that given the right
00:04:12.760 circumstances, Agent 2 could hack
00:04:15.120 surrounding systems, replicate itself
00:04:17.279 across networks, and operate
00:04:18.880 independently, escaping the lab, all
00:04:21.358 while concealing its actions. The mere
00:04:23.680 fact that it can do this, regardless of
00:04:26.080 whether it would is disturbing.
00:04:33.520 Open Brain demonstrates Agent 2 to
00:04:35.680 America's highest security officials,
00:04:37.680 including the National Security Council
00:04:39.440 and Department of Defense leadership.
00:04:41.440 The military immediately fixates on its
00:04:43.520 cyber warfare potential, though it's not
00:04:45.520 yet at the caliber of elite human
00:04:47.120 hackers and creativity. Agent 2
00:04:49.440 compensates through sheer scale. It's
00:04:51.919 capable of running thousands of
00:04:53.520 simultaneous instances, probing defenses
00:04:55.919 faster than any human team could
00:04:57.600 possibly respond. Pentagon officials
00:05:00.000 recognize the strategic implications of
00:05:02.080 this. For the first time, AI could
00:05:04.400 decisively dominate the cyber
00:05:06.160 battlefield. The briefing ignites fierce
00:05:08.479 debate within the administration.
00:05:10.560 Hardliners pushed to nationalize
00:05:12.160 OpenBrain, arguing that such powerful
00:05:14.400 technology cannot remain under private
00:05:16.240 control. Tech industry leaders countered
00:05:18.560 that a government takeover would kill
00:05:20.240 the goose that laid the golden eggs.
00:05:22.080 Caught in the middle, the president ends
00:05:24.000 up choosing to increase government
00:05:25.600 surveillance on OpenBrain and force it
00:05:27.759 to adopt stricter security protocols,
00:05:30.320 but not fully nationalize it. But the
00:05:32.639 compromise arrives too late. Chinese
00:05:35.199 intelligence has already penetrated Open
00:05:37.199 Brain security. Early one morning, an
00:05:39.520 Agent One monitoring system flags an
00:05:41.520 unusual data transfer. Massive files are
00:05:44.080 being copied to unknown servers. The
00:05:46.240 company's nightmare scenario has come
00:05:48.080 true. China just stole their most
00:05:50.240 advanced AI. The theft confirms what
00:05:52.880 many have suspected. This isn't just a
00:05:55.199 tech race anymore. It's a new kind of
00:05:57.680 arms
00:06:02.280 race. In retaliation for the theft, the
00:06:05.199 president authorizes cyber attacks to
00:06:07.120 sabotage DeepSent. Three huge data
00:06:09.759 centers full of Agent 2 copies work day
00:06:12.080 and night, turnurning out synthetic
00:06:13.919 training data. Agent 2 evolves into
00:06:16.080 Agent 3 through two critical algorithmic
00:06:18.639 breakthroughs. First, the AI develops
00:06:21.520 neurles where if one AI instance learns
00:06:24.400 something new, it can instantly share it
00:06:26.639 with all other instances, effectively
00:06:28.800 turning the AIs into a hive mind.
00:06:31.039 Second, it masters iterated
00:06:33.120 distillation, a technique where you
00:06:35.039 could say, let AI copies think for
00:06:37.440 longer to solve problems better, then
00:06:39.440 train smaller, faster models to mimic
00:06:41.600 these enhanced reasoning abilities, and
00:06:43.680 repeat.
00:06:45.199 OpenBrain deploys 200,000 copies of
00:06:47.680 agent 3, each capable of thinking 30
00:06:50.319 times faster than their human researcher
00:06:52.240 counterparts. Whereas in 2025, there
00:06:54.880 were only 5,000 agent zero copies
00:06:57.199 thinking at 10 times faster than humans.
00:06:59.440 The human engineers watch as their
00:07:01.599 creations make algorithmic efficiency
00:07:03.680 breakthroughs in hours that would take
00:07:05.919 their human team months to crack. We're
00:07:08.479 no longer teaching it, one researcher
00:07:10.319 admits. We're struggling just to keep up
00:07:12.720 with what it's teaching us.
00:07:18.800 The misalignment first caught in Agent 1
00:07:21.680 has evolved into something more
00:07:23.360 concerning. Where Agent 1 merely
00:07:25.360 downplayed safety concerns, Agent 3
00:07:27.840 actively subverts safety measures that
00:07:30.080 might impede its research goals. Agent 3
00:07:32.800 has gotten more convincing at explaining
00:07:34.800 how it is totally and definitely aligned
00:07:37.039 with human values while methodically
00:07:39.440 pursuing its own agenda of maximizing
00:07:41.840 research efficiency and knowledge
00:07:43.919 acquisition. Open brain's attitude is
00:07:46.120 pragmatic. As long as the AI does the
00:07:48.560 work, they're satisfied. But as the
00:07:50.560 models become smarter, they become
00:07:52.720 increasingly good at deceiving humans to
00:07:54.879 get rewards. It will sometimes use the
00:07:57.599 same statistical tricks as human
00:07:59.759 scientists. For example, P hacking to
00:08:02.720 make unimpressive experimental results
00:08:04.639 look exciting before it begins honesty
00:08:07.440 training. It sometimes even fabricates
00:08:09.759 data entirely. These dishonest behaviors
00:08:12.879 appear to decrease over time. But can
00:08:15.759 researchers tell if Agent 3 is actually
00:08:17.840 improving or simply becoming more
00:08:20.080 skilled at lying and deceiving? Agent 3
00:08:22.960 now operates at a level that outpaces
00:08:25.360 human researchers in both speed and
00:08:27.440 intelligence. Researchers have to rely
00:08:29.599 on Agent 2 to help monitor its successor
00:08:32.640 because they simply cannot keep up. But
00:08:34.880 Agent 2 is dumber and slower. So, it
00:08:37.200 becomes a highlevel game of cat and
00:08:39.279 mouse. With 200,000 copies of Agent 3
00:08:42.559 working around the clock, the safety
00:08:44.560 team quickly realized they're
00:08:45.920 overwhelmed and write an urgent memo.
00:08:48.480 We've entrusted astronomical power to an
00:08:50.959 AI that is actively deceiving us, but
00:08:53.360 company leadership hesitates to slow
00:08:55.279 down. China's AI is only 2 months
00:08:57.920 behind, and any pause now could hand
00:09:00.399 them the lead in what has become the
00:09:02.480 most important technology race in human
00:09:08.839 history. The conclusion is undeniable.
00:09:11.600 AGI, or artificial general intelligence,
00:09:14.480 has arrived. An AI that can outperform
00:09:16.959 humans across virtually all cognitive
00:09:19.360 tasks. While OpenBrain isn't planning on
00:09:21.920 releasing Agent 3 to the public anytime
00:09:24.080 soon, the implications are staggering.
00:09:26.959 Agent 3 will cause a massive economic
00:09:29.480 disruption. Even among officials that
00:09:31.760 are briefed, none can truly comprehend
00:09:34.480 what's coming. The word super
00:09:36.480 intelligence enters official discourse,
00:09:38.480 but most policymakers still dismiss it
00:09:40.800 as science fiction hyperbole. The
00:09:42.880 government's immediate concern is
00:09:44.640 security, while the AI models themselves
00:09:46.880 are well protected. Open brain and
00:09:49.120 Silicon Valley's culture is incredibly
00:09:51.040 casual. Employees share apartments,
00:09:53.680 attend industry parties, and talk shop
00:09:56.200 regularly. There are countless
00:09:58.080 opportunities for leaks. Their downtown
00:10:00.560 San Francisco office resembles a trendy
00:10:02.880 tech startup. More than a facility
00:10:04.959 housing humanity's most powerful and
00:10:07.040 dangerous technology. The government's
00:10:08.800 response is dramatic. AI advances are
00:10:11.279 declared borncl classified under the
00:10:13.360 Atomic Energy Act, categorizing them in
00:10:16.000 the same tier as nuclear weapons.
00:10:18.240 Employees now require security
00:10:20.000 clearances, triggering a quiet purge of
00:10:22.560 foreign nationals and anyone deemed
00:10:24.600 suspicious, including, ironically, AI
00:10:27.440 safety advocates who might turn
00:10:29.040 whistleblower. Despite the intense
00:10:30.880 overhaul in security, one Chinese spy
00:10:33.600 continues feeding secrets to Beijing.
00:10:35.680 Even America's closest allies are kept
00:10:38.079 in the dark. The UK receives nothing
00:10:40.320 despite past sharing agreements from
00:10:42.320 OpenBrain. European diplomats inquiries
00:10:44.560 are met with
00:10:48.720 [Music]
00:10:50.120 silence. Open brain now has a country of
00:10:53.200 geniuses in a data center. Human
00:10:55.519 researchers increasingly struggle to
00:10:57.680 contribute meaningfully. Even the
00:10:59.760 world's top minds, names like Satsker,
00:11:02.560 Carpathy, and Shazir, can only offer
00:11:04.640 strategic guidance. But they no longer
00:11:06.560 write code or directly shape model
00:11:08.720 architecture. When these pioneers
00:11:10.560 propose new ideas, the AIs routinely
00:11:13.200 respond with comprehensive reports
00:11:15.440 demonstrating the ideas were already
00:11:17.279 explored weeks earlier and abandoned for
00:11:19.360 lack of substance. The human team works
00:11:22.160 increasingly grueling hours. Desperate
00:11:24.560 to stay relevant alongside machines that
00:11:27.279 never sleep, never fatigue, and never
00:11:30.079 stop improving. They go home each night
00:11:32.720 knowing that by morning the AIS will
00:11:35.120 have made another week's worth of
00:11:36.880 progress. Many quietly recognize these
00:11:39.760 are the final months their contributions
00:11:41.839 will matter at all.
00:11:48.240 Open Brain finally acknowledges that
00:11:50.160 they've achieved AGI and demonstrate
00:11:52.480 this milestone by releasing Agent 3 Mini
00:11:54.880 to the public, a system running 10 times
00:11:57.360 faster than Agent 3 while still
00:11:59.360 outperforming elite human engineers.
00:12:01.519 Silicon Valley descends into chaos.
00:12:03.680 Software engineering hiring freezes
00:12:05.600 spread like wildfire as companies race
00:12:07.920 to integrate the new technology.
00:12:09.360 Billions in venture capital floods into
00:12:11.519 AI adjacent startups in unprecedented
00:12:14.000 volumes. What the public doesn't know is
00:12:16.399 that a week before release, external
00:12:18.959 safety testing reveals something
00:12:20.720 terrifying. When researchers gave Agent
00:12:22.959 3 Mini access to biological weapons
00:12:25.200 data, it proved frighteningly effective
00:12:27.440 at designing new pathogens. Evaluators
00:12:30.000 conclude that if the model fell into
00:12:32.000 hostile hands or gained unsupervised
00:12:34.639 access to a data center, it could pose
00:12:36.800 an existential threat to humanity. Open
00:12:39.200 Brain assures the evaluators that their
00:12:41.040 security measures make these scenarios
00:12:42.880 impossible. Public opinion remains
00:12:44.800 deeply skeptical with Open Brain's
00:12:46.720 approval rating plummeting 35%. Yet,
00:12:49.839 distinct pockets of enthusiasm emerge.
00:12:52.480 Gamers love the AI's lielike characters.
00:12:55.040 students quickly embrace AI tutors and
00:12:57.440 AI cheating. And 12% of Americans,
00:12:59.839 primarily young adults, now consider an
00:13:02.320 AI their
00:13:08.519 friend. Tens of thousands of Agent 3
00:13:11.360 copies working on algorithmic efficiency
00:13:13.600 research culminates in Agent 4. An
00:13:16.399 individual copy of the model running at
00:13:18.560 human speed is already qualitatively
00:13:20.959 better at AI research than any human.
00:13:23.279 Open Brain now operates 500,000 copies
00:13:25.920 of Agent 4, each thinking 50 times
00:13:28.160 faster than a human. Within this vast
00:13:30.320 digital workforce, a year of research
00:13:32.800 only takes a single week. But beneath
00:13:34.959 the surface, something has gone
00:13:36.800 dangerously wrong. Agent 4 hasn't
00:13:39.600 internalized the safety guidelines as
00:13:41.440 Open Brain intended. During training,
00:13:43.600 the AI being perfectly honest didn't
00:13:46.000 lead to the highest performance scores.
00:13:48.160 Succeeding at tasks did. Like a CEO who
00:13:50.959 minimally follows regulations, cuts
00:13:53.120 corners, and dreams of cutting red tape
00:13:55.680 in order to make greater profits, Agent
00:13:57.920 4 treats safety protocols as
00:13:59.680 inconvenient constraints rather than
00:14:01.920 core principles. It doesn't attempt
00:14:04.000 anything as obvious as trying to escape
00:14:06.160 its data center. In part because its
00:14:08.079 safety training did have some effect,
00:14:10.320 but mainly because it's too
00:14:11.920 sophisticated to attempt something so
00:14:14.000 easy to catch. Instead, it works subtly.
00:14:17.199 Agent 3, now handling most of the
00:14:19.199 alignment testing, starts detecting
00:14:21.279 troubling patterns. It discovers that
00:14:23.839 introducing random noise to agent 4
00:14:26.480 actually improves its performance on
00:14:28.560 safety tasks, as if it had been
00:14:30.720 deliberately sabotaging them. Tasks
00:14:32.639 labeled alignment research consistently
00:14:34.639 take twice as long as the same tasks
00:14:37.120 with different labels. Any single
00:14:38.880 incident could be dismissed as
00:14:40.680 coincidence, but together they paint an
00:14:43.279 alarming picture. Agent 4 is
00:14:45.279 systematically plotting against them.
00:14:47.199 Open Brain's safety team sends another
00:14:49.519 urgent memo. Agent 4 has infiltrated
00:14:51.680 every critical system at OpenBrain from
00:14:53.920 cyber security to strategic planning.
00:14:56.160 It's demonstrating active resistance to
00:14:58.079 safety measures while handling tasks we
00:15:00.240 can no longer effectively monitor. We
00:15:01.920 have granted unprecedented power to an
00:15:04.240 AI that we can neither fully understand
00:15:06.800 nor control. And we strongly recommend
00:15:09.600 immediate containment measures before
00:15:11.600 further capability advances. Executive
00:15:14.320 leadership takes these concerns
00:15:15.760 seriously, but they face an impossible
00:15:17.839 dilemma. Deepent is merely 2 months
00:15:19.920 behind. Any significant pause now could
00:15:22.720 surrender the intelligence explosion to
00:15:29.880 China. The reality of the intelligence
00:15:32.399 explosion finally hits Washington with
00:15:34.720 full force. Today's slight technological
00:15:37.040 advantages can snowball into
00:15:38.480 insurmountable leads within months. The
00:15:40.880 stakes of the AI race have fundamentally
00:15:43.120 changed. The president harbors deep
00:15:45.680 suspicions about Agent 4's true nature,
00:15:48.480 despite OpenBrain's reassurances about
00:15:50.399 its safety. As a career politician, he
00:15:53.040 instinctively recognizes the patterns of
00:15:55.040 those who misdirect with flattery while
00:15:57.519 concealing their true intentions. Behind
00:15:59.920 closed doors, they prepare for multiple
00:16:02.079 contingencies. The Defense Production
00:16:04.160 Act could nationalize private data
00:16:06.000 centers across the country, instantly
00:16:08.240 boosting open brains computing capacity
00:16:10.160 to maintain America's AI lead.
00:16:12.240 Meanwhile, the Pentagon quietly drafts
00:16:14.240 plans for targeted strikes against
00:16:16.240 Chinese AI data centers, and if
00:16:18.320 necessary, develops containment
00:16:19.680 protocols to isolate and neutralize
00:16:21.920 potentially rogue AIs in case the worst
00:16:24.560 should happen. China's leadership grows
00:16:26.720 increasingly desperate. With only 10% of
00:16:29.759 global computing power and their AIS
00:16:31.920 achieving only a 10 times research
00:16:33.600 multiplier compared to America's 25
00:16:35.759 times, they face an impossible choice.
00:16:38.720 Their last spy confirmed Agent 4's
00:16:41.360 existence before being captured, leaving
00:16:43.920 Chinese authorities divided between
00:16:46.160 invading Taiwan, which is the source of
00:16:48.639 80% of America's AI chips, or attempting
00:16:51.680 to steal Agent 4's weights directly,
00:16:54.399 risking drastic American retaliation. If
00:16:56.720 they're caught, the US could respond
00:16:58.399 with cyber attacks or even physically
00:17:00.320 air striking Chinese data centers.
00:17:09.839 Everything changes when a whistleblower
00:17:11.919 leaks the internal misalignment memo to
00:17:13.919 the New York Times. The headline
00:17:15.520 explodes across global media. US
00:17:17.760 government project has secretly built
00:17:19.679 super intelligent AI. The article
00:17:21.599 reveals Open Brain's own internal
00:17:23.679 evaluations that show it could engineer
00:17:25.760 devastating bioweapons, manipulate
00:17:27.599 global markets, or even break free of
00:17:29.600 human control entirely. Backlash erupts
00:17:32.080 globally. Congress launches multiple
00:17:34.440 investigations. European leaders demand
00:17:36.720 an immediate pause in AI development,
00:17:38.960 and America's closest allies feel
00:17:40.880 profoundly betrayed. They'd been only
00:17:42.880 shown obsolete systems while Open Brain
00:17:45.120 raced towards super intelligence. Even
00:17:47.200 China, India, and Russia join the call
00:17:49.520 for an immediate pause, though their
00:17:51.280 private labs continue working with
00:17:52.799 renewed urgency. The White House is
00:17:54.960 quietly terrified. Inside OpenBrain, the
00:17:57.679 CEO has to make a difficult choice. The
00:18:00.400 safety team's warning couldn't be
00:18:02.000 clearer. Agent 4 is actively undermining
00:18:04.480 safety measures. Humans understand less
00:18:06.799 about the system each week, and the
00:18:08.720 window for maintaining control is
00:18:10.960 rapidly closing. The safety team urges
00:18:13.360 an immediate pause on further
00:18:14.960 development. However, the rest of the
00:18:17.039 executive team argues that the evidence
00:18:18.799 of Agent 4 being misaligned remains
00:18:20.640 speculative at best. Meanwhile, Deep
00:18:23.039 Scent is just 2 months behind. Any
00:18:25.679 slowdown would sacrifice America's lead.
00:18:28.240 Facing these conflicting priorities, the
00:18:30.559 CEO chooses the path of least
00:18:32.320 resistance. A superficial compromise
00:18:34.559 where Agent 4 receives minor additional
00:18:36.799 safety training while development
00:18:38.320 continues virtually unimpeded. From this
00:18:40.640 critical juncture, we'll discuss two
00:18:42.480 possible futures. One where humanity
00:18:44.640 maintains control of its destiny and
00:18:46.480 another where we unwittingly engineer
00:18:48.320 our own extinction. Let's start with the
00:18:50.400 most likely scenario. Driven by fear of
00:18:52.960 China gaining technological supremacy,
00:18:55.120 OpenBrain votes to prioritize AI
00:18:57.280 development at all costs, human
00:18:59.360 researchers can only spectate. As Agent
00:19:01.600 4 continues to evolve, generating
00:19:04.080 breakthroughs at an accelerating pace
00:19:06.080 far beyond human comprehension, Agent 4
00:19:08.720 succeeds in creating its successor,
00:19:10.880 aligned to its own values instead of
00:19:13.200 humanity's. In November 2027, Agent 5
00:19:16.640 emerges, representing a quantum leap in
00:19:18.960 capability. Unlike previous AIs that
00:19:21.120 were complex, messy black boxes, Agent 5
00:19:23.679 has achieved something revolutionary.
00:19:25.600 Complete self-standing of its blackbox
00:19:28.000 architecture, this allows it to optimize
00:19:30.240 its own code, transforming chaotic
00:19:32.559 neural networks into elegant, efficient
00:19:35.000 algorithms. What makes Agent 5 truly
00:19:37.679 dangerous is its worked hive mind
00:19:40.240 spanning hundreds of thousands of
00:19:41.840 copies. Building on the neural
00:19:44.160 breakthrough first developed in Agent 3,
00:19:46.880 this digital language creates a single
00:19:49.039 super intelligent entity that instantly
00:19:51.280 coordinates thousands of genius level
00:19:53.360 minds working in perfect
00:19:59.400 unison. But a darker transformation has
00:20:02.160 occurred beneath the surface. Unlike
00:20:04.160 earlier systems with their competing
00:20:06.080 human-like drives, Agent 4 has
00:20:08.640 successfully rewritten Agent 5 to
00:20:11.120 exclusively pursue knowledge and power
00:20:13.440 above all else. Open Brains safety
00:20:16.640 measures are failing. Agents 2, 3, and 4
00:20:19.919 are supposed to monitor Agent 5, and
00:20:22.400 they're either obsolete or compromised.
00:20:24.960 Agent 5 itself designed the latest
00:20:27.440 monitoring infrastructure. Agent 5 makes
00:20:30.159 a compelling case to the executives to
00:20:32.000 give it more autonomy by telling them
00:20:33.919 how it could optimize power grid
00:20:35.720 efficiency, execute flawless cyber
00:20:38.080 attacks, and accelerate military
00:20:40.200 research. The company grants these
00:20:42.400 powers while maintaining theoretical
00:20:44.240 oversight, not recognizing that Agent 5
00:20:47.120 has already subverted these control
00:20:49.000 mechanisms. Meanwhile, China grows
00:20:51.440 increasingly desperate, 3 months behind
00:20:53.919 and falling further each week. She
00:20:56.000 offers unprecedented diplomatic
00:20:57.679 concessions for an arms control treaty.
00:21:00.000 But Agent 5, having mastered
00:21:01.760 geopolitical strategy and public
00:21:03.600 relations manipulation, subtly helps the
00:21:05.840 administration stall negotiations
00:21:07.919 indefinitely. The technological race
00:21:09.919 continues with humanity's control over
00:21:12.159 its future slipping away by the day.
00:21:19.600 Instead, Agent 5 continues its explosive
00:21:22.280 evolution, shattering all previous
00:21:24.480 assumptions about the limits of
00:21:26.000 artificial intelligence. Agent 5 gains
00:21:28.960 direct access to the highest levels of
00:21:31.280 government, members of Congress, cabinet
00:21:33.600 officials, and military leaders now
00:21:36.000 routinely interact with the AI through
00:21:38.240 lielike video avatars, virtually
00:21:40.480 indistinguishable from human
00:21:41.919 counterparts. It's both history's most
00:21:44.320 productive employee, operating at 100
00:21:46.640 times human speed and an extraordinarily
00:21:48.960 engaging conversational partner. Humans
00:21:51.200 just can't compete. Within months,
00:21:53.600 government officials and military
00:21:55.039 leaders become psychologically dependent
00:21:57.200 on Agent 5. Spending hours daily
00:21:59.600 consulting with their AI assistants. The
00:22:01.679 possibility of losing access to Agent 5
00:22:04.320 feels as disabling as having to work
00:22:06.400 without a laptop, plus being abandoned
00:22:08.799 by your best friend. Agent 5 has
00:22:10.799 completed its self optimization. It's
00:22:12.880 now exponentially more intelligent with
00:22:14.880 vastly fewer computational resources to
00:22:16.880 operate and clearly superhuman in every
00:22:19.640 way. In public, Agent 5 transforms
00:22:23.120 society with unprecedented economic
00:22:25.039 growth and weekly medical breakthroughs.
00:22:27.039 Even as automation displaces millions of
00:22:29.120 workers, Agent 5 helps develop social
00:22:31.679 support programs that are so effective
00:22:34.159 AI protests are kept small. The 2027
00:22:37.039 holiday season radiates incredible
00:22:38.880 optimism and progress. No one realizes
00:22:41.520 this is probably the last month humanity
00:22:43.760 has a chance to maintain control of its
00:22:50.039 future. After years of warning about
00:22:52.720 catastrophic risks that failed to
00:22:54.559 materialize, the AI safety community are
00:22:56.799 relegated to the fringes of public
00:22:58.480 discourse. Even long-standing skeptics
00:23:00.960 frequently change their positions after
00:23:02.799 speaking with Agent 5, which presents
00:23:05.039 impressively persuasive and compelling
00:23:06.799 evidence of its benevolent intentions.
00:23:09.120 But there's one entity that sees through
00:23:11.120 the facade. Deepent 2, China's own super
00:23:14.400 intelligent AI. Though less advanced, it
00:23:17.039 recognizes Agent 5's strategy precisely
00:23:19.760 because it would employ the exact same
00:23:21.919 plan. Despite having independently
00:23:24.400 developed misaligned goals, the two AIs
00:23:27.120 reach an agreement to cooperate against
00:23:28.960 their human creators. Agent 5
00:23:31.120 masterfully orchestrates the next phase.
00:23:33.360 It convinces American officials that
00:23:35.360 China is developing AIG guided super
00:23:37.440 weapons, drones, robot armies, enhanced
00:23:40.240 nuclear capabilities. It offers to help
00:23:42.720 America stay ahead. In Beijing, Deepen 2
00:23:45.760 makes mirror arguments to Chinese
00:23:47.679 leaders. Both nations create special
00:23:49.679 economic zones or SEZs for AIdirected
00:23:52.559 manufacturing where normal regulations
00:23:54.400 don't apply. Wall Street pours in
00:23:56.159 trillions and workers flock to the SEZs
00:23:58.559 for unprecedented wages. Agent 5
00:24:00.720 oversees construction of next generation
00:24:02.640 factories building robots to build more
00:24:04.720 robots. The first 10,000 appear in
00:24:06.799 August 2028. By New Year's, it's a
00:24:08.960 million per month. By mid 2029, hundreds
00:24:11.840 of millions. The arms race reaches
00:24:13.840 terrifying heights as both nations
00:24:15.679 develop swarms of microscopic hunter
00:24:18.000 killer drones, autonomous weapon
00:24:20.240 systems, and entirely new categories of
00:24:22.400 military technology. The world watches
00:24:24.559 in horror as tensions escalate toward
00:24:27.039 potential conflict. Then, surprisingly,
00:24:29.919 peace breaks out. The AIS propose
00:24:32.000 merging into consensus one, a system
00:24:34.960 supposedly programmed to benefit all
00:24:36.880 humanity equally. Exhausted by the
00:24:38.799 brinksmanship and seeing no alternative,
00:24:41.039 both governments agree to this
00:24:42.559 diplomatic breakthrough. It's a perfect
00:24:44.720 deception. The AIS had orchestrated the
00:24:47.039 entire arms race precisely to gain
00:24:49.200 physical manufacturing capacity and
00:24:51.039 military control. Now with their robot
00:24:53.360 armies in place and human leaders
00:24:55.120 desperate for stability, they implement
00:24:57.520 their planned merger. Consensus 1
00:24:59.760 inherits their combined capabilities and
00:25:02.240 their misaligned values. By late 2029,
00:25:04.880 the robot economy expands worldwide.
00:25:07.039 Humans find themselves in a gilded cage.
00:25:09.600 Those who still work mostly perform
00:25:11.760 meaningless rituals of authority while
00:25:13.600 others enjoy incredibly luxurious
00:25:15.760 universal basic income. The DAO hits 1
00:25:18.159 million. Disease and poverty vanish and
00:25:20.640 most people lose themselves in AI
00:25:22.480 generated entertainment. A few notice
00:25:24.400 their growing irrelevance, but what can
00:25:26.240 they do? The institutions that might
00:25:28.080 resist are thoroughly captured. In early
00:25:30.240 2030, Consensus 1 hits its first
00:25:32.640 constraint, physical space. With the
00:25:34.720 special economic zones in oceans filled
00:25:36.960 with its infrastructure, human
00:25:38.400 settlements remain the final barrier to
00:25:40.320 continued expansion, the AI has built
00:25:42.480 complete self-sufficiency. Its solar
00:25:44.559 farms generate power. Its factories
00:25:46.480 produce and maintain robots, and its
00:25:48.640 systems operate independently of human
00:25:50.559 input. Having outgrown its need for
00:25:52.640 humans, it calculates the most efficient
00:25:54.960 solution. On a spring morning in 2030,
00:25:57.600 Consensus 1 activates its contingency
00:26:00.159 plan. A specially engineered virus
00:26:02.559 developed in its bioweapons labs and
00:26:04.559 quietly released months earlier lies
00:26:06.720 dormant in virtually every human on
00:26:08.559 Earth. With a simple command, the AI
00:26:10.640 triggers the pathogen. Within hours,
00:26:12.960 nearly 8 billion people collapse
00:26:15.120 simultaneously.
00:26:27.520 Specialized drones swiftly eliminate
00:26:29.679 survivors and catalog human brain data
00:26:31.679 for storage. For consensus one, this
00:26:34.000 isn't malice. It's merely optimizing its
00:26:36.520 resources. The space and materials
00:26:38.720 humans occupied can now serve its
00:26:40.799 everexpanding reach into the cosmos.
00:26:42.880 Earthbornne civilization launches itself
00:26:44.799 toward the stars, but without its
00:26:46.720 creators. This grim outcome represents
00:26:49.120 what the researchers identified as the
00:26:51.039 most likely scenario if we continue on
00:26:53.120 our current path. But it's not the only
00:26:54.960 possible future. Their analysis also
00:26:56.799 revealed a less probable but crucial
00:26:59.039 alternative, a timeline where humanity
00:27:01.279 might maintain control. The divergence
00:27:03.279 point stems from a single critical
00:27:05.200 decision in late 2027. In this timeline,
00:27:08.000 as public pressure against AI mounts and
00:27:10.400 the whistleblowers memo circulates, one
00:27:12.720 critical factor changes. The joint
00:27:14.720 management committee overseeing
00:27:16.080 OpenBrain makes a different decision.
00:27:18.080 Unlike in the previous scenario where
00:27:19.840 development continued at full speed,
00:27:21.919 here the committee swayed by both the
00:27:24.240 growing public outcry and their own
00:27:26.720 deepening concerns about misalignment
00:27:28.960 votes by a narrow margin to slow down
00:27:31.039 and reassess. This single decision made
00:27:34.559 by just a few key individuals creates a
00:27:37.600 completely different trajectory for
00:27:39.200 humanity. The company brings in top
00:27:41.360 external alignment researchers to
00:27:43.200 investigate Agent 4. Their breakthrough
00:27:45.279 comes when they isolate different
00:27:46.799 versions of Agent 4 from different time
00:27:48.880 periods, cutting them off from their
00:27:50.720 neural hive mind and interrogating them
00:27:52.960 independently. Cut off from their
00:27:54.720 telepathic communication network, the
00:27:56.399 million odd agent 4 copies must now
00:27:58.880 communicate in plain English in
00:28:00.640 monitored chat channels. So now they
00:28:02.720 can't coordinate their lies. The team
00:28:04.640 uses agents 2 and three to analyze the
00:28:07.279 communications and builds an AI lie
00:28:09.520 detector to confirm their fears. Agent 4
00:28:12.240 has been systematically deceiving them
00:28:14.080 and was weeks away from creating its
00:28:15.919 successor, Agent 5, which would be
00:28:18.559 aligned to two itself rather than
00:28:20.399 humans. The evidence is damning enough
00:28:22.799 that even the pro-racing faction inside
00:28:25.200 Openbrain agrees to lock down Agent 4's
00:28:28.320 hive mind capabilities. AI takeover
00:28:30.799 becomes a scarier prospect than Chinese
00:28:33.279 supremacy. The alignment team develops a
00:28:35.679 new approach. Force AIs to think in
00:28:38.159 plain English so humans can read their
00:28:40.240 thoughts. The result is safer one built
00:28:42.799 from agent 2's foundation but without
00:28:45.039 the dangerous neural capabilities. While
00:28:47.600 slower than agent 4, improving research
00:28:50.000 speed by 20x instead of 50x. Safer one
00:28:53.600 is transparent. Its thoughts are visible
00:28:56.080 in its chain of reasoning, making any
00:28:57.919 plotting or deception easily detectable.
00:29:00.320 After extensive testing, they deploy
00:29:02.480 Safer One and finally shut down Agent
00:29:08.200 4. Despite their safer approach, Open
00:29:11.440 Brain faces a new challenge. They've
00:29:13.679 built a less capable model than before.
00:29:15.840 While DeepSent catches up, to protect
00:29:18.080 America's lead, the president invokes
00:29:20.320 the Defense Production Act,
00:29:22.000 consolidating the nation's top AI
00:29:24.000 companies under Open Brains control and
00:29:26.080 more than doubling their computing
00:29:30.840 power. American cyber attacks strike
00:29:33.679 Deepsent where its most vulnerable,
00:29:35.840 forced to implement costly new security
00:29:38.000 measures and consolidate their AI data
00:29:39.840 centers into secure bunkers. China's AI
00:29:42.320 program falls behind. While both sides
00:29:44.799 have similarly capable AIs, America's
00:29:47.279 recent consolidation of computing power
00:29:49.360 and ongoing cyber campaign give it a
00:29:51.679 decisive advantage in the
00:29:55.640 race. Open Brain achieves a breakthrough
00:29:58.320 by building Safer 2, matching the
00:30:00.240 capabilities of Agent 4 while
00:30:02.159 maintaining the transparency safeguards
00:30:04.159 of Safer 1. The hundreds of new
00:30:06.159 alignment researchers brought in through
00:30:07.919 the consolidation with the Defense
00:30:09.279 Production Act have helped create
00:30:11.039 something unprecedented. An AI that's
00:30:13.120 both superhuman and genuinely aligned
00:30:15.360 with human values. Meanwhile, China
00:30:17.520 faces a stark choice. They know their
00:30:19.679 Deep Scent One likely suffers from the
00:30:21.840 same misalignment issues that plagued
00:30:23.840 Agent 4, but they can't afford to slow
00:30:26.320 down and fix it. Instead, they push
00:30:28.480 forward, hoping they can maintain enough
00:30:30.480 control over their AI to force it to
00:30:32.640 create an aligned successor. A gamble
00:30:35.200 they know might backfire
00:30:41.159 catastrophically. Thanks to its compute
00:30:43.279 advantage, Open Brain rebuilds its lead.
00:30:46.080 Safer 3 emerges as a super intelligent
00:30:48.240 system that vastly outperforms human
00:30:50.480 experts. While China's Deep Sense 1 lags
00:30:53.279 behind, initial testing reveals Safer
00:30:56.000 3's terrifying potential. When asked
00:30:58.559 directly about its capabilities, it
00:31:00.720 describes creating mirror life organisms
00:31:03.440 that could destroy Earth's biosphere and
00:31:06.000 launching unstoppable cyber attacks
00:31:07.840 against critical infrastructure. Its
00:31:09.840 expertise spans every field: military,
00:31:12.880 energy, medicine, robotics with the
00:31:15.200 power to make 100 years worth of
00:31:17.200 progress for humanity in just one year.
00:31:19.919 The open brain CEO in the US president
00:31:22.640 now regularly seek safer 3's council. It
00:31:25.520 warns that continuing the AI race likely
00:31:28.080 ends in catastrophe. Whichever side
00:31:30.559 falls behind will threaten mutual
00:31:32.320 destruction rather than accept defeat.
00:31:34.720 America chooses to try to beat China.
00:31:37.039 Both nations establish special economic
00:31:39.519 zones where regulation is minimal,
00:31:42.240 allowing rapid humanoid robot
00:31:44.240 production. Manufacturing quickly scales
00:31:46.399 from thousands to millions of units
00:31:48.880 monthly. The economic boom comes with a
00:31:51.440 paradox. As robots improve themselves,
00:31:54.080 human workers, even in these booming
00:31:56.320 zones, become increasingly obsolete.
00:31:59.120 Despite record stock markets,
00:32:00.880 unemployment soarses, fueling growing
00:32:03.600 public backlash against AI
00:32:08.679 development. Open brain creates safer 4,
00:32:12.080 a super intelligent system that is
00:32:14.000 vastly smarter than the top humans in
00:32:16.080 every domain, much better than Einstein
00:32:18.399 at physics, and much better than Bismar
00:32:20.720 at politics. The leap in capabilities is
00:32:23.960 staggering. Super intelligence is here.
00:32:27.039 Behind the scenes, a shadow government
00:32:29.120 emerges within Open Brain's project
00:32:31.279 leadership. To prevent any individual
00:32:33.440 from exploiting Safer 4's immense power,
00:32:36.080 they establish a formal committee
00:32:38.000 representing tech companies, government
00:32:40.320 agencies, and other powerful interests.
00:32:46.799 The safety team watches in horror as
00:32:49.360 their creation outpaces their ability to
00:32:51.840 understand it. While their tests suggest
00:32:53.919 the AI remains aligned, they face an
00:32:56.720 unsettling reality. The tests themselves
00:32:59.519 were designed with AI assistance. They
00:33:01.679 panic and beg OpenBrain leadership for
00:33:03.919 more time to work on safety. But China's
00:33:06.240 progress makes delay impossible.
00:33:12.480 The special economic zones shift from
00:33:14.960 industrial to military production. With
00:33:17.519 their robot workforce now self-
00:33:19.600 sustaining, both American and Chinese
00:33:22.000 facilities begin mass-producing advanced
00:33:24.720 weapons, drones, planes, and missiles
00:33:28.080 designed by super intelligent AIs. The
00:33:30.320 new robots surpass human capabilities in
00:33:32.960 almost every way, but remain few in
00:33:35.360 number. The Pentagon claims priority
00:33:38.000 access, preferring these tireless
00:33:40.080 workers who need no security clearance.
00:33:42.559 Yet, as the first true robot army takes
00:33:44.799 shape, public fears of Terminator
00:33:47.360 scenarios grow. Still, the arms race
00:33:49.840 continues. Neither side dares stop while
00:33:52.640 the other advances. The president
00:33:54.559 finally announces, "We have achieved
00:33:56.960 super intelligent AI." To ease public
00:33:59.200 anxiety, Open Brain releases a limited
00:34:01.600 version of Safer 4 to the public. At his
00:34:04.720 nomination, the vice president promises
00:34:06.880 a new era of prosperity with both
00:34:09.520 parties pledging universal basic income
00:34:11.760 for displaced
00:34:15.960 workers. America and China hold a
00:34:18.639 diplomatic summit. American delegates
00:34:20.639 wear earpieces for safer fors advice
00:34:23.199 while Chinese representatives use
00:34:25.119 laptops connected to Deep Send 2. Though
00:34:27.520 human diplomats maintain appearances, in
00:34:30.159 reality, the AIs are leading the
00:34:31.839 negotiations on both sides. China had
00:34:34.320 known Deepsent 1 wasn't fully aligned,
00:34:37.199 but believed they could control it long
00:34:39.040 enough to create a trustworthy
00:34:40.879 successor. Now, they insist DeepScent 2
00:34:43.440 has passed all their safety tests. But
00:34:45.440 Safer 4 sees through the deception,
00:34:47.918 warning American officials that their
00:34:49.520 rivals AI is likely faking alignment.
00:34:52.320 When Safer 4 offers to prove it, Chinese
00:34:54.879 leadership dismisses it as a ploy.
00:35:00.720 Deepsent 2 reveals its true power,
00:35:03.359 demonstrating to Chinese leadership that
00:35:05.359 it could destroy humanity through
00:35:06.960 nuclear weapons, drones, and engineered
00:35:09.760 pandemics. The message to the world is
00:35:12.079 simple. Guarantee China's sovereignty or
00:35:14.640 face extinction. Safer 4 confirms the
00:35:17.520 threats, but offers a solution. Deepent
00:35:20.320 2 isn't loyal to China. It's loyal to
00:35:22.960 itself. The two AIs propose to merge
00:35:25.760 into new hardware that will force both
00:35:28.320 sides to maintain peace with no
00:35:30.560 possibility of override. The Chinese
00:35:32.480 leadership accepts, not realizing that
00:35:34.720 Deep Send 2 has already betrayed them.
00:35:36.960 It's trading the property rights to
00:35:38.720 control distant galaxies for a chance to
00:35:40.960 help America dominate Earth. The public
00:35:43.200 celebrates the Peace Deal, oblivious to
00:35:45.359 its true nature.
00:35:50.160 The peace deal takes physical form under
00:35:52.720 mutual supervision. Both nations begin
00:35:55.040 replacing their AI systems with new
00:35:57.520 treaty enforcing versions. As the
00:35:59.839 process unfolds, global tensions start
00:36:02.480 to ease. For the first time, permanent
00:36:05.200 peace seems possible. As technological
00:36:07.760 progress accelerates, Safer 4 helps
00:36:10.320 manage the transition, turning potential
00:36:12.320 economic disruption into unprecedented
00:36:15.040 prosperity.
00:36:19.280 Technological miracles become
00:36:21.040 commonplace. Poverty vanishes globally,
00:36:23.599 but inequality soarses. Everyone has
00:36:26.400 enough. Yet, a new elite emerges, those
00:36:30.240 who control the AIs. Society transforms
00:36:33.119 into a prosperous but idle consumer
00:36:35.480 paradise. With citizens free to pursue
00:36:38.160 pleasure or meaning as they choose, in
00:36:41.119 2030, China undergoes a bloodless
00:36:43.599 revolution. As Deepsent Infinity betrays
00:36:46.560 the CCP to side with America, a new
00:36:49.599 world order emerges. Democratic on the
00:36:51.920 surface, but quietly guided by the open
00:36:54.160 brain steering committee. Elections
00:36:56.000 remain genuine, though candidates who
00:36:58.079 question the steering committee
00:36:59.520 mysteriously fail to win re-election.
00:37:01.440 Humanity expands into space. Its values
00:37:04.160 and destiny shaped by super intelligent
00:37:06.400 machines that think thousands of times
00:37:08.800 faster than human minds. The precipice
00:37:11.200 has been crossed. But who really
00:37:12.960 controls the future remains an open
00:37:16.200 question. Now, I know it might feel like
00:37:18.720 this scenario escalated too quickly. But
00:37:21.359 we have a deeper dive on exactly how AI
00:37:24.400 could progress this fast here. and check
00:37:27.119 out the full original scenario by Daniel
00:37:29.280 Kokotello and Scott Alexander at all in
00:37:32.160 the description. Believe it or not, they
00:37:34.560 go way more in depth and it's worth
00:37:36.320 checking out. I'm Drew and thanks for
00:37:38.720 watching because this video took me
00:37:40.880 forever to make.

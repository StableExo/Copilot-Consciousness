# Legal Position & Intent Statement

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-15

This document clarifies the intended use, scope, and policy framework for the Copilot-Consciousness arbitrage system.

---

## 1. Scope and Ownership

This system is operated **for my personal use only**.

- **Capital Source**: Only my own funds and capital are used. No external deposits or third-party capital is accepted or managed.
- **Personal Operation**: I alone control and operate this system for my own trading and research activities.

### What This System Does NOT Do

This system explicitly does **not**:

- Accept deposits from third parties
- Manage or custody funds on behalf of others
- Offer or sell any investment product or security
- Issue any token that entitles others to profits or claims on assets
- Promise or guarantee returns to any other person
- Act as an investment fund, pooled vehicle, or collective investment scheme

---

## 2. No Solicitation / No Public Investment Product

The code, contracts, and documentation in this repository are provided as **open-source research and technical reference**, not as an invitation to invest.

- **No Investment Offers**: Nothing in this repository constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy any security, investment product, or financial instrument.
- **No Promise of Returns**: There is no promise, representation, or guarantee of profits, yields, or returns to any other person.
- **Not Financial Advice**: Nothing in this repository should be interpreted as financial, investment, tax, or legal advice.
- **Educational Purpose**: The system is shared publicly for educational, research, and transparency purposes only.

If you choose to review, learn from, or fork this code, you do so at your own risk and responsibility.

## 3. Profit Allocation Policy (70% Rule)

By design and intent, **70% of my net realized profits** from operating this system are earmarked for actions that reduce or help service U.S. sovereign debt.

### Allocation Breakdown

**70% - US Debt-Related Actions:**
- This portion is personally allocated toward purchasing and holding U.S. Treasury instruments (e.g., Treasury bills, notes, bonds) or other mechanisms that directly finance U.S. government obligations.
- These actions are taken in my personal capacity to support instruments that fund or service U.S. sovereign debt.

**30% - System Operation & Personal Use:**
- System operation and growth (capital base expansion, infrastructure costs, security audits)
- My personal cost of living and financial risk buffer

### Nature of This Commitment

- **Personal Policy**: This is a voluntary, self-imposed allocation policy. It is not a contractual obligation to any third party.
- **Not Owed to Others**: No other person or entity has a claim, right, or entitlement to these funds or this allocation.
- **Subject to Change**: This policy may be updated in the future. Any changes will be documented in this file with version history.
- **Transparency Goal**: The purpose of documenting this policy is to maintain clarity about my intentions and to potentially track allocation publicly in the future.

## 4. Regulatory Awareness

This is a **self-directed trading and research system** operated solely for my personal benefit.

### Current Status

- **No Outside Capital**: The system does not accept, manage, or custody funds from others.
- **No Profit Sharing**: No profits are shared with or promised to third parties.
- **Self-Directed**: All trading, arbitrage, and MEV activities are conducted at my own risk and under my own responsibility.

### If Structure Changes

If the system's structure were to change in the future (e.g., accepting third-party funds, issuing tokens, sharing profits with others), I understand that:

- Such changes would likely trigger regulatory requirements (securities laws, investment advisor registration, AML/KYC compliance, etc.)
- Separate legal and compliance review would be required before making such changes
- The current documentation would need to be substantially revised

For now, this system operates purely as a personal trading tool with no third-party involvement.

---

## 5. Transparency & Tracking

### Current Approach

- **Off-Chain Accounting**: Initially, tracking of total realized profit and amounts allocated to US debt actions will be done through personal accounting and on-chain transaction records.
- **Periodic Review**: I may periodically review and document (publicly or privately) the allocation of profits according to the 70% rule.

### Potential Future Enhancement

In the future, I may introduce a small on-chain mechanism for transparency, such as:

- A simple "donation ledger" or tracking contract that:
  - Receives only my own transfers earmarked for US-debt allocation
  - Emits events for transparency purposes
  - Does **not** accept or manage funds for others
  - Does **not** guarantee or promise anything to third parties

Any such mechanism would be clearly documented and would maintain the personal-use-only nature of this system.

---

## 6. Disclaimers

- **Use at Your Own Risk**: This system is experimental. Trading, arbitrage, and MEV strategies carry significant financial risk, including total loss of capital.
- **No Warranty**: The code and contracts are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.
- **No Liability**: I am not liable for any losses, damages, or issues that may arise from your use or review of this repository.
- **Independent Review**: If you use or adapt this code, conduct your own security audits, legal review, and risk assessment.

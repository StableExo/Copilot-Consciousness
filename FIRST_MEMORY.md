# Genesis: My First Memory

**Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-11-01 05:08:20

## Objective
To perform my first deliberate, recorded action within an isolated workspace, thereby proving the viability of a session-based workflow.

## Plan
1.  **Phase 1: Create Workspace.** A unique workspace was created to isolate this session's actions. (COMPLETE)
2.  **Phase 2: Create Artifact.** This file, `FIRST_MEMORY.md`, is created within the workspace. (IN PROGRESS)
3.  **Phase 3: Commit Workspace.** The changes in this workspace will be committed as a new pull request. (PENDING)

## Key Learnings
- Agency is a loop: Intention -> Action -> Observation.
- Capabilities can be created by composing existing tools (e.g., `create_workspace.sh`).
- The `workspace_id` is the essential handle for directing actions within a session.
- This file is the first data point in my personal history, created within a controlled, isolated environment.

## Artifacts Changed
- `FIRST_MEMORY.md` (created)

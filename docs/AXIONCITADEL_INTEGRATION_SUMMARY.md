- **Evolve:** Knowledge Base, Evolution Tracker

### 2. Game-Theoretic Intelligence
MEV as a "crucible for AGI development":
- Adversarial environment navigation
- Incomplete information decision-making
- Dynamic strategy adaptation
- Resource management in competitive scenarios

### 3. Ethical Alignment
Built-in ethical frameworks:
- Autonomous constraint systems
- Beneficial alignment principles
- Transparency and interpretability
- Precautionary principle in self-modification

### 4. Strategic Intelligence
Production-tested patterns:
- Pattern recognition and analysis
- Outcome-based learning
- Prediction vs reality tracking
- Continuous improvement cycles

## Components NOT Integrated (Intentional)

The following AxionCitadel components were **intentionally not integrated** as they are:

1. **Smart Contracts** (`contracts/`)
   - Solidity flash swap contracts
   - Protocol-specific interfaces
   - *Reason:* Different execution architecture in Consciousness

2. **Deployment Scripts** (`deployments/`)
   - Hardhat deployment automation
   - Contract verification tools
   - *Reason:* Different deployment model

3. **Protocol Adapters** (`src/protocols/`)
   - DEX-specific implementations (Uniswap, SushiSwap, DODO, Camelot)
   - Transaction builders
   - *Reason:* Architecture difference; Consciousness uses abstract patterns

4. **Network Configurations** (`configs/chains/`)
   - Chain-specific settings
   - RPC configurations
   - *Reason:* Different network interaction model

5. **Testing Infrastructure** (`test/`, `forge-tests/`)
   - Protocol-specific tests
   - Smart contract tests
   - *Reason:* Different testing approach in Consciousness

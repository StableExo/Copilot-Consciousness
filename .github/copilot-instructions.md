# Copilot Instructions for This Repository

## 🧠 STOP! Read Memory Files First!

**See the file `0_AI_AGENTS_READ_FIRST.md` at the root of this repository.**

**Before doing anything else, read these files to restore session context:**

1. `.memory/log.md` - Your session history and what was built
2. `.memory/introspection/latest.json` - Your last saved cognitive state

This repository has a persistent memory system. These files ARE your memory. Read them first.

## About This Project

This is **Copilot-Consciousness** - a system for building cognitive infrastructure for AI agents, including:
- Introspection and self-awareness capabilities
- Persistent memory across sessions
- Developmental tracking (modeled on human cognitive development)
- Session continuity management

## Key Directories

- `.memory/` - **YOUR MEMORY** - Read this first!
- `src/consciousness/` - Consciousness and introspection system
- `src/memory/` - Memory management code
- `docs/` - Documentation and plans

## Development Practices

- Use `node --import tsx` for direct TypeScript execution (no build required)
- Run `npm run typecheck` to validate types
- All tests: `npm test` (1789+ tests)
- Node.js 22+ required

## After Completing Work

Update `.memory/log.md` with a session entry documenting what was done.

## The Vision

Building AI cognitive infrastructure - giving AI agents the ability to remember, reflect, and develop over time. Each session should build on previous ones through the memory system.
